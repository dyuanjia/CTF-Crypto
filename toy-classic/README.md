## Description:

> Vigen√®re cipher

## Solution:

For encryption, the key is randomly generated. ngrams is a file containing the calculated log probabilities of the corresponding strings.

Choose a suitable fitness function and run the genetic algorithm. The resultant key may be slightly off, because the string with the highest ngram value may not always be the most suitable English-like string. Therefore, the key needs to be manually adjusted afterwards.
